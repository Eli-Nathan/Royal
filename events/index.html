              <h5>Perthshire Amber Festival</h5>
              <p>The Royal Dunkeld has been host to the Amber Festival's musicians for the past 5 years. During the festival, which is held annually in late October - early November, we become "The Wee Festival Hall". The music flows through the night
                and the atmosphere here at this time of year is truly magical.</p>
